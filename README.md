# knowledge_base_relation_extraction

An attempt at implemention a relation extraction model with knowledge base integration on biomedical text.

Knowledge base: use TransE to get entity representation

Relation extraction: multichannel CNN model using word, position, hypernyms, siblings embeddings with dependency relations.

TO DO:
- Complete knowledge base model
- Integrate knowledge base model into RE model
- Fix RE model to give better result
